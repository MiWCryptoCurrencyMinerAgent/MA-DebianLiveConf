Statement and Social Contract v1

1. I would never knowingly write or distribute software containing weaknesses, back doors, cryptographic flaws or vulnerabilities.

2. If a vulnerability or otherwise is discovered in any software written or distributed by me, I will take the appropriate measures to reduce the risk to my users and fix the vulnerability.

3. This software may contain open source libraries or binaries that could contain unknown vulnerabilities. If a vulnerability is discovered, I will replace or patch the vulnerable component. You will not hold me liable for the vulnerabilities in others software.

4. If you discover an issue or bug in any software written or distributed by me, please responsibly disclose this to me.

5. I will cryptographically attribute my work, so in the event a malicious attacker impersonates me for the purpose of introducing vulnerabilities, it will be possible to verify that it did not originate from me.
